                      Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) is an important subsistence cereal grown mainly in the relatively dry areas of Western and Lake Basin regions of Kenya. 
                      The cereal is traditionally used for making foods like thin porridge (Uji), stiff porridge (Ugali) and local brew (Busaa).
