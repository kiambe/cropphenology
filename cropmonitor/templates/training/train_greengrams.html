          Grams or mung beans (<i>Vigna radiate</i>) are annual legume crops grown for their seed. Grams could be green, black or yellow in colour.
          <ul>
            <li>The seeds or the flour may be used in a variety of dishes like soups, porridge, snacks, bread, noodles and even ice cream. Green gram also produces great sprouts, which can be sold in health food shops or eaten at home.
            </li>
            <li>It’s a low-cost excellent source of dietary protein (24–28%), folate and iron.</li>
            <li>The crop is grown in an area of 302,000 ha, which produces 149,000 tons annually attributed to expansion of Green gram to non-traditional growing areas due to climate change.
            </li>
            <li>Mung bean is one of the  climate smart technologies recommended for farmers in Arid and semi-arid regions. </li>
          </ul>

                    <p>The crop grows best at an altitude of 0-1600 meters above sea level.</p>
                    <strong>Soil type and conditions</strong>
                    <p>Green grams thrive in a well-drained soil, rich in nutrients and with an optimum PH of 6.0-7.5.</p> 
                    <strong>Temperature range </strong>
                    <p>An optimum temperature of between 28-30<sup>o</sup>C is fit for the growth of green grams. Extreme temperatures affect crop growth and development.</p>
                    
                    <strong>Rainfall</strong>
                    <p>Green grams are relatively drought tolerant and can give reasonable yields with an annual rainfall of between 350-650mm. Too much rain or long dry spells reduce yields. </p>
                    <p>Excessive rainfall during flowering causes flower abortion while dry weather conditions are important during harvesting.</p>
